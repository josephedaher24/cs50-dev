# Activity: Squashing bugs!

1. `alpha.c`
    crashes with segfault. why?
2. `beta.c`
    just hangs ... why?
3. `gamma.c`
    crashes with segfault. why?
4. `delta.c`
    why does this always return `inf` (infinity) ?
5. `epsilon.c`
    when does beef appear on the stack?  
6. `zeta.c`
    why doesn't this insertion sort work?
7. `eta.c`
    pushing onto the queue works, so why doesn't pop work?
8. `theta.c`
    why does this password checker accept the real password "cs50" as well as
    the password "abcdefghijkl" ?
